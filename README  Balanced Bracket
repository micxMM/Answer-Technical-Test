My logic here is to number each bracket, so that if the bracket doesn't meet the same number, there will be an error
related to this, I also use modulus to store data
for example
data now there are 321322
This means that the ones that have to be closed first are 2
with a modulus of 10 I will get 2
then I check the input, 2 means ] is it correct, if it is correct continue, if it is wrong immediately mark it as wrong so it is definitely no because counting here I make K mandatory 0 for yess
